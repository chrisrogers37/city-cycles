# üé≠ Playwright-Based TfL Data Downloader: Review & Recommendations

This document outlines a technical review and recommendations for using Playwright to scrape and download TfL Santander Cycle data files rendered via JavaScript.

---

## ‚úÖ Why Playwright is Needed

The HTML page at `https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/usage-stats/`:
- Is rendered using **Handlebars templates**
- Populates data **dynamically via AJAX**
- Cannot be fully parsed using `requests` or `BeautifulSoup`

**Playwright is the right tool** because it:
- Emulates browser behavior
- Waits for network and DOM events
- Supports file downloads with `wait_for_event("download")`

---

## üîß Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Safe Download Trigger

Avoid triggering download with a blind `page.click()`. Instead:

```python
download = await page.wait_for_event("download")
await page.click(f'a[href="{filename}"]')
await download.save_as(local_path)
```

---

### 2. Download Validation

Ensure files downloaded correctly before uploading:

```python
if not os.path.exists(local_path) or os.path.getsize(local_path) == 0:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Failed to download {filename}. Skipping upload.")
    continue
```

---

### 3. Retry Logic for Resilience

Add a retry loop around download logic:

```python
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        download = await page.wait_for_event("download")
        await page.click(f'a[href="{filename}"]')
        await download.save_as(local_path)
        break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Retry {attempt+1} failed for {filename}: {e}")
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
```

---

### 4. Optional Parallelism (Advanced)

If allowed under TfL rate limits, consider using `asyncio.gather()` to download 2‚Äì3 files concurrently to reduce total runtime.

---

## ‚úÖ Strengths of Current Approach

- Correctly filters and identifies JourneyDataExtract CSVs
- Uses respectful rate-limiting (`asyncio.sleep(1)`)
- Uploads to S3 after each successful download
- Cleans up temporary files to save space

---

## üîö Summary

The current Playwright approach is robust and production-ready. The suggestions above enhance error handling, reliability, and clarity while staying within TfL's terms.
